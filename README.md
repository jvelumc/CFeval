# CFeval <!-- badges: start --> <!-- badges: end -->

Predictions under interventions are estimates of what a subjectâ€™s risk
would be if they were to follow a certain counterfactual treatment.
Assessing predictive performance for these predictions is challenging,
as only the outcome of the realized treatment can be observed.(Keogh,
van Geloven, DOI 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001713). This R package
facilitates assessing counterfactual performance of interventional
predictions.

## Installation You can install the development version of CFeval from

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jvelumc/CFscore")
```

## Toy example

Simulate some example data for binary outcome Y and (point) treatment A,
confounded by a variable L. Variable P is a prognostic variable for only
the outcome. The treatment reduces the risk on a bad outcome (Y = 1) in
this simulated example.

If either model is to be used to decide on treatment options A, we need
accurate estimates of the counterfactual risk on outcome under both
treatment options A = 1 and A = 0.

Validating a model capable of estimating counterfactual risks is
challenging. This package aims to guide the user in assessing how well
the predictions would match the validation data if all individuals had
followed the treatment under which predictions are made.

The main function CFscore() estimates these counterfactual performance
measures in a validation dataset, printing all assumptions required
along the way.

``` r
df_val <- build_data(4000)
CFscore(
  data = df_val,
  model = causal_model, 
  Y_column_name = "Y", 
  propensity_formula = A ~ L
)

#> [1] "The following assumptions must be satisfied for correct inference:"
#> [1] "[1] Conditional exchangeability requires that {L} is sufficient to adjust for confounding and selection bias between A and Y."
#> [1] "[2] Positivity (Assess IPW in the output with $weights)"
#> [1] "[3] Consistency"
#> [1] "[4] No interference"

#> 1   O/E ratio 1.0086552 1.0362503 1.0009945

#> 
#> Naive performance is the model performance on the observed validation data.
#> CF0/CF1 is the estimated model performance on a CF dataset where everyone was untreated/treated, respectively.
```

Compare that to the counterfactual performance of the naive model:

``` r
CFscore(
  data = df_val,
  model = naive_model,
  Y_column_name = "Y",
  propensity_formula = A ~ L,
  quiet_mode = TRUE # hides all the additional output.
)
#>        Metric     Naive       CF0       CF1
#> 1   O/E ratio 0.9951249 1.1702066 0.8575212
#> 2         AUC 0.7573108 0.7672527 0.7453966
#> 3 Brier score 0.1991375 0.1978137 0.2101898
```
