# CFeval <!-- badges: start --> <!-- badges: end -->

Prediction under interventions considers estimating what a subject’s risk would be if they were to receive a certain treatment. Likewise one may be interested in assessing predictive performance in a setting where all individuals were to receive a certain treatment option. This is challenging, as only the outcome of the realized treatment level can be observed in the data, and outcomes under any treatment option are counterfactual.(Keogh, van Geloven, DOI 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001713). This R package facilitates assessing counterfactual performance of predictions.

## Installation
