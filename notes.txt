To discuss:
---
On what data is the null model trained? Development data? Observed validation
data? CF validation data?
---
How is the null model bootstrapped?
---
What does a bootstrapped calibration plot look like?
---
Do we want to provide function for observed score too? And how to frame?
recommended?

To do:
stabilization = T/F
