Description: Predictions under interventions are estimates of what a subject's risk would be 
  if they were to follow a certain counterfactual treatment. Assessing predictive performance
  for these predictions is challenging, as only the outcome of the realized treatment can be
  observed.(Keogh, van Geloven, DOI 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001713). This R package facilitates 
  assessing counterfactual performance of interventional predictions.
