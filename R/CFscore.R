#' Counterfactual validation score
#'
#' @param object One of the following three options to be validated:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item a numeric vector, corresponding to risk predictions
#'   \item a glm or coxph model
#'   \item a (named) list, with one or more of the previous 2 options, for
#'   validating and comparing multiple models at once.
#' }
#' @param data A data.frame containing at least the observed outcome, assigned
#'   treatment, and necessary confounders for the validation of object.
#' @param outcome_formula A formula which identifies the outcome (left hand
#'   side). E.g. Y ~ 1 for binary and Surv(time, status) ~ 1 for time-to-event
#'   outcomes. In right censored data, the right hand side of the formula is
#'   used to estimate the inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) model.
#'   Alternatively, the IPCW can also be specified themselves using the ipcw
#'   argument, in which case the right hand side of this formula is ignored.
#' @param treatment_formula A formula which identifies the treatment (left hand
#'   side). E.g. A ~ 1. The right hand side of the formula can be used to
#'   specify the confounders used to estimate the inverse probability of
#'   treatment weights (IPTW) model. E.g. A ~ L, where L is the confounder
#'   required to adjust for treatment. The IPTW can also be specified themselves
#'   using the iptw argument, in which case the right hand side of this formula
#'   is ignored.
#' @param treatment_of_interest A treatment level for which the counterfactual
#'   perormance measures should be evaluated.
#' @param metrics A character vector specifying which performance metrics to be
#'   computed. Options are c("auc", "brier", "oeratio", "oeratio_pp",
#'   "calplot"). See details.
#' @param time_horizon For time to event data, the prediction horizon of
#'   interest.
#' @param cens.model Model for estimating inverse probability of censoring
#'   weights (IPCW). Methods currently implemented are Kaplan-Meier ("KM") or
#'   Cox ("cox") both applied to the censored times.
#' @param null.model If TRUE fit a risk prediction model which ignores the
#'   covariates and predicts the same value for all subjects. The model is
#'   fitted using the data in which all subjects are counterfactually assigned
#'   the treatment of interest (using the IPTW, as estimated using the
#'   treatment_formula or as given by the iptw argument). For time-to-event
#'   outcomes, the subjects are also counterfactually uncensored (using the
#'   IPCW, as estimated using the outcome_formula, or as given by the ipcw
#'   argument).
#' @param stable_iptw if TRUE, estimate stabilized IPTW weights. See details.
#' @param bootstrap If this is an integer greater than 0, this indicates the
#'   number of bootstrap iterations, to compute 95\% confidence intervals around
#'   the performance metrics.
#' @param iptw A numeric vector, containing the inverse probability of treatment
#'   weights. These are normally computed using the treatment_formula, but they
#'   can be specified directly via this argument. If specified via this
#'   argument, bootstrap is not possible.
#' @param ipcw A numeric vector, containing the inverse probability of censor
#'   weights. These are normally computed using the outcome_formula, but they
#'   can be specified directly via this argument. If specified via this
#'   argument, bootstrap is not possible.
#' @param quiet If set to TRUE, don't print assumptions.
#'
#' @returns A list with performance metrics.
#'
#' @details auc is area under the (ROC) curve, estimated ...
#'
#'   Brier score is defined as 1 / sum(iptw) sum(predictions_i - outcome_i)^2
#'
#'   oeratio and oeratio_pp represent the observed/expected ratio, where
#'   observed is the mean of the outcomes in the pseudopopulation. For oeratio,
#'   the expected is the mean of the predictions in the original observed
#'   population. For oeratio_pp, expected is the mean of the predictions in the
#'   pseudopopulation. A perfect model will have oeratio_pp equal to exactly
#'   one, but not necessarily oeratio equal to one, if the size of the
#'   (weighted) pseudopopulation is not exactly equal to the size of the
#'   original population.
